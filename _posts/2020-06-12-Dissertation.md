Cho, B. Shine. 2020. “Participatory Budgeting Institutional Change: A Case Study of the Seoul Metropolitan Government (2012-17)” \[Doctoral dissertation, University of Nebraska at Omaha\]

My dissertation examines participatory budgeting (PB), which countries in the Global South and Europe have utilized extensively but is a relatively new public budget participation mechanism in the U.S. I conducted a longitudinal case study of the Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea by investigating how and why their participatory budgeting institution changed over time. This study questioned which types of institutional change occurred in which dimensions of public participation, and how those changes affected the degree of public participation. I observed a series of PB institutional changes related to budgeting politics, such as a dispute between the PB Committee and the Seoul Metropolitan Council over budget allocation authority, bargaining among 25 local governments within Seoul to allocate a larger portion of the PB budget to their jurisdiction, and conflicts between the PB Committee and the PB Support Council over the authority to lead PB institutional design and implementation.
