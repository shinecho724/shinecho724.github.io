Participatory budgeting (PB) is facing severe challenges under the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic impacts on local government budgeting and financial management shrunk the capacity to set PB budgets aside from the general fund. Moreover, the challenge of “untact” for the post-pandemic world threatens the “quality deliberation” in the PB budget allocation process. [New York City’s PB, for instance, was cancelled this year.]( https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-participatory-budgeting-new-york-city-council-20200316-hh7t2m2g65avlaahggtrq5gz2y-story.html) </br>

Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea, on the other hand, is implementing the 2020 participatory budgeting process while its schedule was delayed and modified. Studying this year's PB in Seoul would provide valuable practical and scholarly contributions. </br>

It is too early to analyze it, but here are two pieces of document to check: [the stenographic records of the [1st](https://yesan.seoul.go.kr/comm/comm0403View.do?bbsId=BBSMSTR_000000000063&nttId=3033&pageIndex=1) and [2nd](https://yesan.seoul.go.kr/comm/comm0403View.do?bbsId=BBSMSTR_000000000063&nttId=3046&pageIndex=1_) PB Support Council meetings. </br>
