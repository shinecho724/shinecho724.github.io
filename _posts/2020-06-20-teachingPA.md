Recently, one of my Korean colleagues, [Dr. Taehee Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taehee-kim-60a73953/) shared my friend Del M.N. Bharath's article titled [Film in Public Administration Classrooms: Developing Responsible Administrators in the Information Age](https://doi.org/10.1177/0144739420929384) on her Facebook page. Many Korean professors echoed her opinion to use films in public administration classes and shared their experiences. It seems that they will further their discussion during the summer and make a list for Korean public administration students. 
Different classes may need to use different multimedia resources: a show for students in the US may be irrelevant for Korean students. Nevertheless, I would like to share further resources to check, particularly the works and resources of my colleagues at University of Nebraska at Omaha. 

[Del M.N. Bharath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delbharath/) also wrote a film review titled [Ethical Decision Making and the Avengers: Lessons from the Screen to the Classroom](https://doi.org/10.1080/10999922.2019.1600352). It is a short, but very interesting read. 

[Dr. Gary Marsharll](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/public-administration/about-us/faculty-staff/gary-marshall.php)'s [Applying Film to Public Administration] on Administrative Theory & Praxis is also a must-read. He presents a thorough review of the literature and theoretical discussion about the film and public administration. 

[Dr. Elizabeth Gillespie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Gillespie3] who will join the University of Memphis this coming fall semester is generous sharing her resource [Social Social Justice Documentaries 2010-2020.docx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_USJSeRpT8RkaEcvxXotiGWVUvlVAV3QYZkb4PznvpRAgkr1HeW6imtiqQPwpaw/pub?fbclid=IwAR00ahe5iCLX-jyU-dzjwr77J7eURBKTwFEf1y5z67pNuEwKrqCScbHwOqQ). 

Also, [Journal of Public Affairs Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/upae20/current) has very interesting reads, such as [Jurkiewicz & Giacalone (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15236803.2000.12023483) and [Yu & Campbell (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15236803.2020.1746137).
